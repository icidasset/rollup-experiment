# Rollup experiment

A sample single-page app that uses [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/) as the module bundler.

Goals:

- Keep the tool chain super simple and fast (eg. no babel or webpack)
- Keep the dependencies as low as possible, but still have good-looking/understandable code

```shell
brew install node
brew install watchexec # watch for file changes

npm run dev
```
